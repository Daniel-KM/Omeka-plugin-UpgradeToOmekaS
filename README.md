Upgrade to Omeka Semantic
=========================

[Upgrade to Omeka Semantic] is a plugin for [Omeka Classic] that allows to
upgrade automatically your installation from [Omeka 2] to [Omeka S]. It upgrades
records, files, config, themes and some plugins.

[Omeka S] is a remastered, up-to-date and improved release of Omeka, built for
the semantic web, multi-sites and multilingual. So this plugin allows to use new
features without the mess-up of a manual upgrade process. The original install
of Omeka Classic is kept and not modified: it remains available. If the upgrade
is fine for your digital library or your exhibit, simply modify the paths on
your server.

Of course, if a plugin doesn’t exist under Omeka S, it won’t be upgraded.
Furthermore, a processor should be written to upgrade data. There are already
such a  processor for the most common plugins, that are integrated or have an
equivalent module: [Dublin Core Extended], [Embed Codes], [Exhibit Builder],
[Geolocation],  [More User Roles],  [Simple Pages], [Social Bookmarking], [Universal Viewer].
If enabled, the modules will be automatically installed. For other plugins,
contact me.

See the full list of [plugins for Omeka 2 and matching modules for Omeka S].

A compatibility layer is available for themes with the module [Upgrade from Omeka Classic],
that is installed automatically too. The themes are restructured and upgraded,
but custom functions may fail. In that case, use [official themes] or contact me
too. Anyway, in all cases the theme should be reviewed, because there may be
some visual glitches.

Omeka S is still in a beta phase, but it can be already used for common sites.


Benefits
--------

* Ids of items

One important benefit against the standard upgrade process or via [Omeka 2 Importer]
is that the id of items are kept, so the common urls publicly used on the web
are not lost. The id of collections and files are lost. This is related to the
fact that Omeka Semantic uses a single id for all resources. Users are upgraded
too, but they have to ask for a new password on the login page. The pages and
exhibits keep their slugs.

Anyway, it’s always recommended you set your own single and permanent
identifiers that don’t depend on an internal position in a database. The term
`Dublin Core Identifier` is designed for that and a record can have multiple
single identifiers. There are many possibilities: named number like in a library
or a museum, isbn for books, or random id like with ark, noid, doi, etc. In
Omeka 2, they can be displayed in the public url with the plugin [Clean Url].

Furthermore, the compatibility layer adds a route for old urls `items/show/#id`
to the new format `item/#id` and redirects them to the items of the specified
site of Omeka S.

* Automatic process and speed

A second benefit is that the process is fast and automatic. You don’t need to
ask your IT department for a new server, or to process an initial setup, that is
a little longer in Omeka S (even very simple) since there is no default site.
Indeed, the config itself is upgraded. For example, the path to the php  cli, a
common question on the forum of Omeka forum, is kept.

This is mostly transparent to the admin and to the users: they won’t see
anything change (if the theme is fully checked). Conversely, the curators will
benefits from all the new features of Omeka S. The machines too: Omeka S is
designed to share its resources larger and in a more standardized way than
Omeka 2.

The last important benefit is that your site will respond visibly faster,
especially when PHP 7 is used, since Omeka S is based on [Zend 3] and [Doctrine].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder `UpgradeToOmekaS`.

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.

*IMPORTANT*: Even if the original files and the original database are only read,
backup your database AND your files before the process and check them before the
process.

The plugin has been tested from v2.3.1, but it probably works with Omeka v2.2.2.
Just change the setting in plugin.ini to try it.

You may need to upgrade your plugins to the current version. Only enabled and
up-to-date plugins are processed.

There will be no update of this plugin for a version of Omeka S after the first
one, because Omeka S manages its own upgrades and migrations processes. But
there will be update for new versions of Omeka Classic and integration of
processors for plugins.


Usage
-----

The process is automatic from an up-to-date Omeka install. Log in as a super
user, then simply click on "Upgrade" in the top admin bar, fill the short form,
click the `Submit` button, wait from a few tens of seconds, and click on the
provided url.

The urls of the main page and of the login page are provided. If the main page
is broken, fix the theme or log in and change the theme to one of the [official themes]
or use on upgraded official theme of Omeka Classic.

To add a new upgrader, simply add it in the directory `/libraries/UpgradeToOmekaS/Processor`
or use the filter `upgrade_omekas`. You can look in the upgrader `Escher.php`
for a basic upgrader.

To add a new addon to the lists, simply add its main url in the matching csv
file in the directory `docs/_data/` and run the php script (here from the root
of Omeka):

```
    php -f plugins/UpgradeToOmekaS/docs/_scripts/update_data.php
```


Internal Upgrade Process
------------------------

The upgrade process follows these steps. All steps are automatic except the
first and the last.

* *IMPORTANT*: backup your database and your files manually and check them.
* Optional: create manually the database if you want a separate one, else, the
  database will be shared with the one of Omeka Classic. This is not a problem,
  but currently, Omeka S doesn’t manage prefixes. Fortunately, there was one by
  default in Omeka 2 ("omeka_"). Furthermore, Omeka 2 creates tables with plural
  names (like "users") and Omeka S uses singular names ("user"), so even if the
  prefix was removed during install, there won’t be issue. Anyway, it’s
  recommended to create a separate database.
* Checks.
  * rights to write in the specified directory
  * version and config of Omeka
  * version of plugins
* Set the site down, except for the super user.
* Fetch last release of Omeka S from Github, uncompress it and install it.
* Set parameters.
  * new database or current one
  * main settings
* Conversion of all Omeka Classic tables (users, records, plugins...) into the
Omeka Semantic ones via simple mysql queries.
* Copy of files, hard links (recommended on linux servers), soft links or dummy
  files.
* Copy, reorganize and upgrade themes.
* Install the compatibility layer and upgraded plugins.
* Check manually main settings and parameters of each module of Omeka Semantic.

The site will be available automatically at the end of the process with the
specified link.

Enjoy it!


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.
